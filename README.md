SnesBox
=======

Arduino code that takes shift register input from two SNES controllers and simulates keyboard pressed. Based on code from: http://inf.ufrgs.br/~rgsilva/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=public:hardware:snes

Please note that this will only run on an Arduino Leonardo or Micro as these will be recognised as a virtual keyboard
